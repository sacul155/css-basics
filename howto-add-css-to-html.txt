There are three methods to add CSS to HTML.  The first is external CSS.

External CSS
Most common method, links separate CSS file to HTML file.
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
Here are the steps to adding external CSS:
    * add a void <link> element to the head of the HTML file.
    * the "href" attribute is a link to the CSS file, either absolute or relative.  The above example assumes that the 
      file "styles.css" is in the same directory as the HTML file.
    * the "rel" attribute is required and specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.


Internal CSS
This involves adding the CSS directly in the HTML file itself.  The code is placed inside <style> tags, which is inside 
of the <head> tag.  This does not require a <link> element.  Besides these differences, syntax is exactly the same as 
external CSS.  This is useful for styling a single webpage.

Inline CSS
This method adds CSS directly inside of HTML elements using the "style" class and then writing in the desired CSS 
properties.
