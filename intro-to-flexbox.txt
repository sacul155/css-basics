* Flexbox is a way to arrange boxes in rows and columns.  These boxes can grow or shrink (flex) based on set rules.
* A flex container is any element that has display: flex on it.
* A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container.
* An element can be both a flex container AND a flex item.  So you can set the display on a flex item to flex and then use
  flexbox to arrange its children as well.

Growing and Shrinking
---------------------
The flex shorthand
* The flex declaration is shorthand for three different properties you can set on a flex item.  The properties are:
    * flex-grow 
        - applies a growth factor to an item. 1 denotes proportional growth between all items.  If a 2 were set on just 
          one of the items, it would grow 2x as much as the others.
    * flex-shrink 
    * flex-basis
* So for the following CSS, a value of 1 for the flex property:
    div {
        flex: 1;
    }
  would mean a flex-grow value of 1, a flex-shrink value of 1, and a flex-basis value of 0.
