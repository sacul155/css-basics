Cascading in CSS refers to the order in which rules are applied.  It's important to understand the mechanics of cascading
so that you know which elements are going to be affected and in what hierarchy they are applied.

Specificity
More specific CSS declarations take precedence over less specific ones.  The order is:
    1. Inline styles 
    2. ID selectors (most specific selector)
    3. Class selectors
    4. Type selectors
A rule with a greater number of selectors takes specificity over a rule with less selectors.
Combinator symbols do not add to specificity.

Inheritance
An elements descendants will inherit any rules applied to the parent without it being specified, unless that child 
element is directly specified in CSS.

Rule Order 
The last rule that breaks the tie if all other rules have been taken into account is the order rule.  Whichever rule was 
last stated in CSS is the rule that takes precedence, assuming all other rules have been checked.
