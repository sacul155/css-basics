Most elements learned thus far have their default style set as display: block.  These elements appear stacked on top of 
each other and each one appears on a new line.  Inline elements do not start on a new line but rather start next to 
the element they are placed beside.

Divs and spans are non-specific elements that are used to contain other grouped elements.  Divs are block-style elements
and spans are inline-style elements.

Overriding Normal Flow
So normal flow basically refers to how HTML elements are naturally displayed on a webpage if not changed in CSS.  For
example, block-level elements will stack on top of each other and start on new lines, and inline elements will be placed 
beside elements and stay on the same line.
* The display property
    * changing the display value of elements can make them behave differently than normal by using block, inline, or 
      inline-block properties.
* Floats
    * applying a float value like left can cause block-level elements to wrap alongside another element.
* Position
    * the position property allows you to control the placement of boxes inside other boxes.  Static is the default 
      positioning, but a different value like fixed can fix a box to the top of the browser's viewport.
