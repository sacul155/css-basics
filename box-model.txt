Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box.  You can illustrate this by adding an outline to the styling of the 
page.
    * {
        outline: 2px solid red;
    }
Headings are boxes, so are paragraphs, lists, every item in a list, buttons, and links.

There are many ways to manipulate the size and space between these boxes, including border, margin, and padding.
    * padding - increases the space between the border of a box and the content inside the box.
    * margin - increases the space between the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes.
    * border - adds space between the margin and the padding, essentially creating a visible box outline.

Block and Inline Boxes 
Boxes have a display property that determine how boxes behave relative to other boxes.  If a box has a display property 
value of "block", then:
    *the box breaks onto a new line 
    *the width and height properties are respected
    *padding, margin, and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box 
    *if width is not specified, the box will expand to fit the size of its container
Elements like <p> and <h1> use block as their default outer display.
If a box has inline as its display property value then:
    *the box does not break onto a new line 
    *the width, height, and top and bottom margins will have no effect
    *top and bottom padding and borders will change the size of the box without affecting the position of surrounding 
     content, causing things to overlap.

Parts of a box 
The smaller boxes that make up a block box in CSS are as follows:
    * content box - area where content is displayed; size it using width and height properties 
    * padding box - sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties 
    * border box - wraps content and padding; size it using border and related properties 
    * margin box - the outermost layer, wraps everything else and the whitespace between the box and other elements; size 
      it using margin and related properties.
In the standard box model, when setting width and height property values on a box, it only applies to the content box.
Padding and borders are added separately to get the full size of the box:
    .box {
        height: 150px;
        width: 350px;
        margin: 10px;
        padding: 25px;
        border: 5px solid black;
    }

Changing margin values 
You can alter positioning of boxes by changing each individual margin value with margin-top, margin-bottom, 
margin-left, and margin-right.
Margins between different elements do not add, rather they collapse and the one with the larger margin is used.  Padding 
can be altered the same way.

Border values 
You can also change the dimensions, width, color, and style of borders by using border-top, border-color,
border-style, border-width, and any combination of these.
