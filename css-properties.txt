The color property sets an element's text color, and the background-color property sets its background color.
These properties can accept keyword values, or RGB, HEX, and HSL values.  Here are examples for each in code:
    p {
        /* hex */
        color: #1100ff;
    }

    p {
        /* rgb */
        color: rgb(100, 0, 127);
    }

    p {
        /* hsl */
        color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);
    }
Hexadecimal colors are specified with #RRGGBB, with each value being between 00 and FF.  FF is the highest value.
RGB colors are set with values between 0 and 255 or 0 and 100%.  You can add a fourth number by adding an a to rgb and
setting that value between 0.0 and 1.0 to change the opacity.
HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.  Hue is a degree on the color wheel - 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is
blue.  Saturation is a percentage with 0% being gray and 100% being the full color.  Lightness is also a percentage with 
0% being black and 100% being white.

font-family
changes the font of specified text and uses either a font family name like "Times New Roman" or a generic
family name like serif.  Generic names never use quotes.  Including multiple fonts is useful in case a browser cannot
display a certain font.  The first one listed will be used and if not the following ones are used.

font-size
sets the size of font.  Ex: font-size: 22px;

font-weight
sets boldness of text using either a keyword like "bold" or a number between 1 and 1000.  Ex: font-weight: 700;

text-align
aligns text horizontally within an element.  Use keywords left, center, and right.  Ex: text-align: center;

You can adjust the size of an image using the height and width properties.  If you want adjust the size of an image 
without losing its proportions, set one or the other to auto.  Ex:
    img {
        height: auto;
        width: 500px;
    }
