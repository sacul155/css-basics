You can modify how items are aligned inside a container by using alignment properties.

* justify-content - aligns items along the main axis (usually the horizontal axis).  If flex-direction is set to row, the 
  items move horizontally to achieve the desired alignment.  If set to row, they move vertically.  So whichever axis is 
  the main axis, justify-content will affect that axis.

* align-items - aligns items along the cross axis.  If flex-direction is set to row, aligns vertically. If set to column,
  aligns horizontally.

The gap property is another feature of flex that can set space between items.  Simply provide a value in pixels:
    gap: 10px;
